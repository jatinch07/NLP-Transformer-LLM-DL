# NLP-Transformer-LLM-DL
This repository contains my self project on the use of Transformers and LLMs in the field of NLP. Tasks like sentiment analysis, spam detection, entity recognition and text generation are provided with the full working code.

The realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has witnessed a seismic transformation with the introduction of Transformers, an innovative class of models that has redefined the boundaries of language understanding and generation. These models, built on self-attention mechanisms, have emerged as the driving force behind the remarkable progress in NLP tasks. This project embarks on a journey to explore the transformative capabilities of Transformers in the context of NLP.

The exponential growth of data, coupled with the evolving intricacies of human language, necessitates cutting-edge techniques that not only comprehend textual content but also generate coherent and contextually relevant responses. Transformers, with their capacity to capture global context and relationships within text, have catalyzed breakthroughs across a spectrum of NLP applications. They stand as a testament to the symbiotic relationship between the theoretical insights of machine learning and the practical applications of deep learning.

## Transformers for NLP

This project is an immersive exploration of the capabilities of pre-trained transformer models. It traverses the landscape of text classification, named entity recognition, summarization, machine translation, question-answering, and more, harnessing the power of models like BERT, GPT, and their successors. It also bridges the gap between traditional NLP techniques and modern neural networks. It imparts insights into vector models, probability models, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning architectures, laying a robust foundation for understanding the nuances of modern NLP.

## Project Objective 

The core objective of this project is to showcase the synergistic potential of combining transformer-based methods with traditional NLP techniques. This entails a comprehensive exploration of both the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of transformers, with an emphasis on fine-tuning models on custom datasets. Through this integration, we will delve into the mechanisms of attention, explore masked language modeling, zero-shot classification, and immerse ourselves in the intricacies of BERT, GPT, and their derivatives.


This project embarks on a mission to unlock the potential of transformer models in NLP, highlighting their transformative prowess and the intricate interplay between traditional techniques and modern innovation. The subsequent sections unfold the path traversed, the challenges surmounted, and the knowledge gleaned from this endeavor.
